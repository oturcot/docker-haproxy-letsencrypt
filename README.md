## Introduction

This project sets up HAProxy in a Docker container to manage HTTP and HTTPS traffic with automatic Let's Encrypt wildcard certificate renewal. It leverages `acme.sh` for certificate management and uses Cloudflare's DNS-01 challenge for secure and automated certificate issuance and renewal.

**This project was made and tested on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.**

## Features

- **Dockerized HAProxy**: Simplifies deployment and management.
- **Automatic Certificate Renewal**: Uses `acme.sh` for Let's Encrypt wildcard certificates.
- **DNS-01 Challenge**: Secure validation via Cloudflare API.
- **Separate LAN and WAN Frontends**: Listens on ports 80, 443, and 10443.
  - **LAN Frontend**: Accessible on ports 80 and 443.
  - **WAN Frontend**: Accessible on port 10443.
  - You can set your internal DNS to point directly at the HAProxy server for internal services.
  - In your firewall, port forward the WAN IP on port 443 to the HAProxy server on port 10443 to expose only the desired services.
- **Watchtower Integration**: Automatically updates Docker containers.
- **Systemd Service**: Monitors certificate changes and reloads HAProxy.

## Prerequisites

- A server running **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS** or compatible.
- Root or sudo access to the server.
- A domain name with DNS managed by Cloudflare.

## Installation

### 1. System Update and Upgrade

Start by updating your system packages to ensure all dependencies are up to date.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### 2. Install Docker and Docker Compose

Install Docker using the official installation script. Docker Compose is included with the Docker installation.

```bash
# Install Docker
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
```

**Note:** Docker Compose is now included as part of the Docker installation and is invoked using `docker compose` instead of `docker-compose`.

### 3. Install Inotify-tools

Inotify-tools are required for the systemd service to monitor certificate changes.

```bash
sudo apt install inotify-tools -y
```

## Configuration

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your server.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oturcot/docker-haproxy-letsencrypt.git
cd docker-haproxy-letsencrypt
```

### 2. Edit Environment Variables

The `.env` file in the project root stores your Cloudflare API credentials securely. Edit this file to include your actual Cloudflare email and API key.

```bash
vim .env
```

Replace the placeholders with your actual Cloudflare email and API key:

```dotenv
CF_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
CF_API_KEY=your-cloudflare-api-key
```

**Important:** Ensure that `.env` is included in `.gitignore` to prevent sensitive information from being pushed to GitHub.

### 3. Edit Docker Compose Configuration

The `docker-compose.yml` file is included in the repository. Edit this file to adjust configurations as needed.

```bash
vim docker-compose.yml
```

**Notes:**

- Replace `/absolute/path/to/docker-haproxy-letsencrypt/` with the actual absolute path to your project directory.
- Ensure that the paths in the `volumes` section point to the correct locations on your server.

### 4. Edit HAProxy Configuration

The `haproxy.cfg` file is located in the `haproxy` directory. Edit this file to match your actual domains and backend server IPs.

```bash
vim haproxy/haproxy.cfg
```

**Notes:**

- Replace `example.com`, `service1.example.com`, `service2.example.com`, and IP addresses with your actual domains and IPs.
- Adjust the ACLs and backends according to your needs.

### 5. Systemd Service Setup

The systemd service files `watch_certificates.sh` and `watch_certificates.service` are included in the repository.

#### a. Edit the `watch_certificates.sh` Script

Edit the `watch_certificates.sh` script in the project root to reflect the correct paths.

```bash
vim watch_certificates.sh
```

- Replace `/absolute/path/to/docker-haproxy-letsencrypt/` with the actual absolute path to your project directory.
- Replace example.com with your actual domain name.

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x watch_certificates.sh
```

#### b. Install the systemd Service File

Copy the `watch_certificates.service` file to the `/etc/systemd/system/` directory.

```bash
sudo cp watch_certificates.service /etc/systemd/system/
```

#### c. Reload and Enable the Service

Reload systemd to recognize the new service, then enable and start it.

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable watch_certificates.service
sudo systemctl start watch_certificates.service
```

#### d. Verify the Service Status

Check if the service is running correctly.

```bash
sudo systemctl status watch_certificates.service
```

You should see an active (running) status.

## Running the Services

Navigate to your project directory and start the Docker containers using Docker Compose.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This command will start the HAProxy, Watchtower, and `acme_sh` containers in detached mode.

## Issuing and Installing Certificates

### 1. Configure `acme.sh` to Use Let's Encrypt

Set Let's Encrypt as the default Certificate Authority (CA).

```bash
docker exec acme_sh acme.sh --set-default-ca --server letsencrypt --home /acme.sh
```

### 2. Issue a New Certificate

Run the following command to issue a new Let's Encrypt wildcard certificate using the DNS-01 challenge with Cloudflare.

```bash
docker exec acme_sh acme.sh --issue --dns dns_cf -d example.com -d '*.example.com' --keylength 4096 --home /acme.sh
```

**Explanation:**

- `--dns dns_cf`: Uses Cloudflare DNS API for DNS-01 validation.
- `-d example.com -d '*.example.com'`: Specifies the domain and wildcard domain.
- `--keylength 4096`: Sets the key length to 4096 bits.

### 3. Install the Certificate

Install the issued certificate and specify the paths for the key and full chain files.

```bash
docker exec acme_sh acme.sh --install-cert -d example.com -d '*.example.com' \
  --key-file       /acme.sh/example.com/fullchain.cer.key \
  --fullchain-file /acme.sh/example.com/fullchain.cer \
  --home           /acme.sh
```

**Notes:**

- `acme.sh` saves the key as `fullchain.cer.key` when specified.
- Since you have a systemd service that monitors certificate changes and reloads HAProxy, you do not need to specify a `--reloadcmd`.

### 4. Ensure Correct File Naming

Make sure that the key file is named `fullchain.cer.key` in the certificate directory. HAProxy can automatically find the key if it is named correctly and located in the same directory as the certificate.

### 5. Update HAProxy Configuration

Ensure your `haproxy.cfg` points to the correct certificate file:

```haproxy
frontend LAN_Frontend
    bind *:443 ssl crt /etc/haproxy/certs/example.com/fullchain.cer ssl-min-ver TLSv1.3
    # ... rest of your configuration ...
```

**Notes:**

- HAProxy will automatically find the corresponding key file if it is named `fullchain.cer.key` and located in the same directory.

### 6. Restart HAProxy

Your systemd service should automatically reload HAProxy when the certificate files change. However, you can manually restart HAProxy to ensure it's using the new certificate.

```bash
docker restart haproxy
```

## Verification

### 1. Check Certificate Details

Use OpenSSL to verify that HAProxy is serving the new Let's Encrypt certificate.

```bash
echo | openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 -servername example.com 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -issuer -dates
```

**Expected Output:**

```
issuer=CN=R3,O=Let's Encrypt,C=US
notBefore=Nov 16 07:00:00 2024 GMT
notAfter=Feb 14 07:00:00 2025 GMT
```

### 2. Monitor Logs

Ensure that HAProxy has reloaded successfully by checking its logs.

```bash
docker logs haproxy
```

Look for entries indicating a successful reload.

### 3. Test Automatic Renewal

Force a certificate renewal to test the entire process, including the systemd service reloading HAProxy.

```bash
docker exec acme_sh acme.sh --renew -d example.com -d '*.example.com' --force --home /acme.sh
```

Monitor the systemd service logs to confirm HAProxy reloads.

```bash
sudo journalctl -u watch_certificates.service -f
```

You should see output indicating that HAProxy has been reloaded.

## Security Best Practices

- **Protect API Keys:** Do not expose your Cloudflare API key in configuration files. Use environment variables or Docker secrets.
- **Use Scoped API Tokens:** Instead of using your global Cloudflare API key, create an API token with limited permissions (e.g., DNS-01 challenge permissions).
- **Secure `.env` Files:** Ensure that your `.env` files are not tracked by version control by adding them to `.gitignore`.
- **Set Proper File Permissions:** Restrict access to sensitive files like certificates and keys.
- **Regularly Update Containers:** Use Watchtower to keep your Docker containers up to date with the latest security patches.
- **Limit Exposure:** Only expose necessary ports and services to the internet. Use firewalls to restrict access where possible.
